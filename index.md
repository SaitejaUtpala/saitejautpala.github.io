## About Me

Hi! I am a associative ML scientist at Wadhwani AI. staff research associate at University of California, Santa Barbara. I am also Lead Engineer/Maintainer for the Open source library <a href="https://github.com/geomstats/geomstats">Geomstats</a>. Before that, I worked as a software engineer at Mastercard and I completed my Masters at IIT Kanpur in Computer Science.

## Research Interest

statistical learning theory, geometric statistics, geometric (deep) learning, uncertainty estimation
